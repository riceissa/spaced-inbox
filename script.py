# TODO: one thing that smooth.sh did that the new-as-of-January-2023 version
# doesn't do is having different quotas for the different inbox text files. If
# I do a large import of a new "stream" like browser bookmarks or something,
# then the reviews will (after 50 days) probably get dominated by these browser
# bookmarks. There should be some way to be like "limit browser bookmarks to at
# most 1% of all reviews" or something.  For now this hasn't been a problem for
# me, but it is something I will probably want to handle at some point.
# I notice that I want to specify weights using different methods. For
# example, with something like browser bookmarks, i want to say "don't make
# this thing dominate the reviews". but i may also want to say something like
# "github projects ideas repo notes should get a bit of penalty because they
# tend to be boring".  A bit thing to keep in mind that some inbox files
# can contain WAY more notes than some others.

# TODO: i am realizing that i often purposely don't fix some typos on boring
# notes because i reason that if i *do* fix them then that will reset the
# review schedule to 50 days, which i don't want. maybe there should be some
# way to make trivial changes without affecting the review schedule.
